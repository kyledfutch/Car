# EML4804 Spring 2025 - Project 2: Autonomous Car
## Overview
Build a simple car as follows:
- Two green LEDs, a yellow LED, and a red LED in an arrow formation with two green towards the
front, the yellow in the middle, and read towards the back. Yellow indicates a stop movement,
the green ones light up for forward motion and the red for reverse motion.
- The car should travel down a hallway without running in to the walls and at 50 cm from the end,
the car will stop, do a 180 degree turn and come back the hallway without hitting walls.
- The car should move one meter forward, turn 90 degrees left and move one meter, then turn 90
degrees left and move one meter, finally turn 90 degrees left and move one meter to reach your
starting position.

## Components Used
- Arduino board.
- One Ultrasound sensor.
- 9v battery and the 9v power adapter.
- One Stepper motors for rotating the ultrasound sensor.
- Four DC motors with wheels.
- L298N motor controllers.
- A number of AA battery holders (max six 1.5 v batteries/motor controller).
- Small breadboard.
- Wiring.
- LEDS
